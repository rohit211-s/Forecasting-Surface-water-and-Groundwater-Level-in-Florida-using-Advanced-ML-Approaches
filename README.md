# Forecasting-Surface-water-and-Groundwater-Level-in-Florida-using-Advanced-ML-Approaches

In this study, we investigate the application of deep learning models for forecasting surface water discharge and groundwater levels across 46 and 45 stations respectively in Florida. The datasets for surface water and groundwater consist of daily records of discharge in cubic feet per second and groundwater levels above NGVD 1929 in feet, respectively. We employ a range of deep learning models, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Neural Basis Expansion Analysis (N-BEATS), Neural Hierarchical Interpolation for Time Series (NHITS), Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT), and Informer, to predict the current day's value based on the previous day's measurements. Our comparative analysis focuses on the performance of these models using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE), and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) as error criteria. The results demonstrate that the NHITS model consistently outperforms the other models across all stations and error metrics, establishing its superiority in capturing the temporal dynamics of both surface water and groundwater in the region. This study underscores the potential of NHITS and deep learning approaches in improving the accuracy of hydrological forecasting, contributing valuable insights for water resource management and planning in Florida.![image](https://github.com/rohit211-s/Forecasting-Surface-water-and-Groundwater-Level-in-Florida-using-Advanced-ML-Approaches/assets/67229152/1b28b99d-85ce-49f3-867f-843097f52add)
