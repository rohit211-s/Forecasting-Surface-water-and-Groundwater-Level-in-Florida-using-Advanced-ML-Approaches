# Forecasting-Surface-water-and-Groundwater-Level-in-Florida-using-Advanced-ML-Approaches

## Abstract

Effective water resource management and planning rely heavily on accurate forecasting of surface water discharge and groundwater levels, particularly in hydrologically intricate regions like Florida. This study conducts a large-scale analysis across the entire state of Florida, systematically evaluating the efficacy of five advanced deep learning models—Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Neural Basis Expansion Analysis for Interpretable Time Series Forecasting (N-BEATS), Neural Hierarchical Interpolation for Time Series (N-HiTS), Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT), and Informer—using extensive datasets from 45 surface water stations and 45 groundwater monitoring wells, spanning 23 years (2001-2023). Unlike traditional methods that use different models for predicting surface water and groundwater, we demonstrate that the same models can effectively forecast both surface water discharge and groundwater levels. After rigorous data preprocessing, including cleaning and normalization, these models were trained and tested to predict daily water dynamics. Our analysis reveals that the N-HiTS model consistently delivers superior performance for both surface water discharge and groundwater levels. Specifically, N-HiTS was the best-performing model in 23 out of 45 groundwater wells based on Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and in some wells, it achieved an RMSE that was 70% less than that of the next best model, TFT. N-HiTS led 34 out of 45 stations using Normalized RMSE (NRMSE) for surface water discharge, consistently achieving at least a 20% lower NRMSE than the next-best model in all leading stations. These findings demonstrate N-HiTS's exceptional ability to capture temporal dynamics in hydrological data, offering a powerful tool for enhancing predictive accuracy in water resource management. This research provides crucial insights into the application of deep learning models in hydrological forecasting, with significant implications for resource planning in Florida and similar regions.

## Introduction  

The accurate forecasting of surface water discharge and groundwater levels is crucial for effective water resource management and planning, particularly in regions like Florida, where water resources play a pivotal role in supporting the local ecosystem and economy. The state of Florida, with its unique hydrological characteristics, presents a challenging yet essential area for hydrological studies. The region's water dynamics are influenced by the interaction between the extensive surface water network, including rivers, lakes, and wetlands, and the underlying Floridan Aquifer, one of the world's most productive aquifers (Vu, M. T. et al., 2023). 

Using large-scale data from the entire state of Florida is important for improving the accuracy of hydrological models, especially because of the complex interactions between surface water and groundwater in the area. Florida’s water system is highly connected, with significant exchanges between surface water bodies and the Floridan Aquifer, one of the most active and productive aquifers in the world (Sutton, J. E. et al., 2015). These exchanges vary across different locations and times, making it essential to use data from all over the state to accurately capture these changes. A large-scale approach helps models learn from diverse conditions, including differences in rainfall, evaporation, and human activities like groundwater pumping, which are key to making reliable predictions (Gordu, F., & Nachabe, M. H., 2023). This approach reduces regional biases and improves the models' ability to work well under different weather and water conditions, supporting more effective water management and planning across Florida.

Recent advancements in deep learning have shown promising potential in improving the accuracy of hydrological forecasting. Deep learning models, with their ability to capture complex nonlinear relationships and temporal dependencies in data, are well-suited for predicting hydrological variables. In this study, we explored the application of various deep learning models, including LSTM, N-BEATS, N-HiTS, TFT, and Informer, for forecasting daily surface water discharge and groundwater levels across multiple stations in Florida.

This study utilizes a diverse suite of deep-learning models, each engineered to address different aspects of time-series forecasting. The LSTM networks fall under the category of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which are particularly adept at capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data. This makes them suitable for applications that require memory of past events, such as natural language processing and sequential prediction  . In contrast, both N-BEATS and N-HiTS   belong to the category of Feedforward Neural Networks. N-BEATS employs a unique architecture designed to forecast time series directly through stacks of fully connected layers, focusing on a data-driven approach without reliance on traditional time-series forecasting methods. N-HiTS, similarly, introduces a hierarchical architecture that enhances the model's ability to interpolate and forecast at various time scales effectively. 

Additionally, the research incorporates models that leverage advanced attention mechanisms within the transformer framework, namely the TFT and the Informer. TFT combines high-capacity transformers with a recurrent-style gating mechanism to adeptly handle dynamic relationships between variables in multivariate, multi-horizon time-series data. The Informer extends the transformer architecture to efficiently manage long-sequence forecasting, implementing a novel self-attention mechanism that reduces computational demands while retaining effectiveness over extended data sequences. These models represent the forefront of machine learning techniques, offering sophisticated solutions to the complex challenges presented by modern time-series analysis.

Our research is motivated by the need to enhance the predictive capabilities of hydrological models for both surface water and groundwater, which are essential for understanding water dynamics and making informed decisions in water resource management, flood prevention, and drought mitigation.By comparing the performance of these deep learning models, we aim to identify the most effective approach for capturing the temporal dynamics of hydrological variables in the entire state of Florida. 

Various machine learning (ML) models have been effectively utilized to improve groundwater and surface water forecasting accuracy. For instance, SVM and NARX have been applied to forecast groundwater levels in South Africa (Aderemi et al., 2023). Random Forest algorithms have been used to predict groundwater levels from passive seismic wavefields (Abi Nader et al., 2023; Muhumuza, 2020; Onyebuchi, 2020). Additionally, ML has been employed to predict groundwater potentiality in semi-arid mountainous regions (Jadoud et al., 2023). Despite their successes, ML models also exhibit several disadvantages. They often struggle with long-term dependencies and complex nonlinear relationships in time series data, which are essential for accurate hydrological predictions. Additionally, they require extensive feature engineering and preprocessing, which can be resource-intensive and may not scale well with large datasets.

These limitations can be potentially overcome by deep learning models. Deep learning models, particularly those using architectures like LSTM, are well-suited to address these challenges. LSTMs are capable of learning long-term dependencies without the need for manual feature extraction, making them ideal for modeling the temporal dynamics of groundwater and surface water levels. For example, LSTMs have been used to predict groundwater recharge (Huang et al., 2023; Patra et al., 2023) and multi-step-ahead groundwater levels (Koch et al., 2023). They have also been applied to sustainable groundwater management (Alabdulkreem et al., 2023) and groundwater quality prediction (Valadkhan et al., 2022; Jaffar et al., 2022). While LSTM models are powerful for handling sequential data, they come with certain limitations. They are computationally inefficient with long sequences, making training and inference slow. LSTMs can overfit small datasets due to their complexity, and careful tuning of hyperparameters like layer count and unit size is needed to avoid underfitting or overfitting.

The aforementioned challenges can be addressed by using more recent advancements in neural network architectures, specifically, those falling into the categories of feedforward neural networks like N-BEATS and N-HiTS, as well as attention mechanisms like TFT and Informer. These models offer several improvements over LSTMs .   

In terms of practical applications, N-BEATS has been implemented in various studies related to groundwater and surface water predictions. For instance, it has provided robust long-term forecasts from intermittent observation data (Vu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023), groundwater level predictions across multiple locations (Mbouopda et al., 2022), and integrating multiple time series data sources to enhance water level prediction accuracy (Kenda et al., 2020). These examples highlight the versatility and efficiency of N-BEATS in environmental data analysis, offering a promising alternative to LSTM for hydrological modeling tasks. Building upon the successful application of the N-BEATS model, the N-HiTS model advances forecasting with hierarchical interpolation and multi-rate data sampling techniques. It has shown improvements in accuracy and efficiency in large-scale forecasting (Challu et al., 2023), has been used to predict traffic flow (Lu et al., 2024), forecast product demand in retail (Kollipara et al., 2022), and predict solar and wind energy outputs in renewable energy forecasting (Mazen et al., 2023; Di Grande, 2024). These implementations underline the N-HiTS model's versatility and robust performance across different forecasting scenarios.

Following the discussion on the N-HiTS model, another advanced approach in the field of time series forecasting is the TFT. TFT has shown remarkable success in hydrology-related forecasting tasks by effectively integrating multiple data inputs and handling complex temporal dynamics. TFT enhances prediction accuracy and provides superior alternatives to traditional models like LSTM and standalone Transformer models. For example, TFT improves streamflow prediction accuracy (Koya et al., 2024; Wei, 2023; Vu, 2023), river level prediction with improved probabilistic forecasting and uncertainty quantification (Wang et al., 2023), and flood forecasting by modeling spring flood formation for long-term maximum water level predictions (Castangia et al., 2023). These applications underline the TFT model's versatility and robust performance in hydrology.

Building on the insights gained from N-HiTS and TFT models, the Informer model emerges as another powerful tool in the forecasting landscape, particularly noted for its efficiency in handling long sequences and reducing computational overhead, which is critical in hydrology. It has been applied in drought forecasting, demonstrating superior performance over traditional models like ARIMA and LSTM, especially at longer timescales, using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) (Shang et al., 2023).

Despite significant advancements in hydrological modeling, most existing studies have limitations that our research aims to address. Previous research often focuses on smaller, localized datasets, limiting the models’ ability to generalize across broader regions with varying hydrological conditions. By conducting our study on a large scale across the entire state of Florida, we address this gap, capturing the complex and diverse interactions between surface water and groundwater that smaller-scale studies may miss. This comprehensive approach allows for a more robust understanding of hydrological dynamics, enhancing the predictive capabilities of the models under various climatic and hydrological scenarios (Vu, M. T. et al., 2023). Additionally, many prior studies typically use separate models for predicting surface water discharge and groundwater levels, which increases computational costs and resource requirements. Our research breaks new ground by demonstrating that a single model can effectively forecast both surface and groundwater dynamics, streamlining the forecasting process and reducing the need for multiple models. This unified approach not only improves efficiency but also ensures consistent and comparable predictions across different water systems, setting our study apart from traditional methods.

In   summary, this study presents a novel approach by 1) developing and comparing the performance of five deep learning models—LSTM, N-BEATS, N-HiTS, TFT, and Informer—on extensive hydrological data from Florida to identify the most accurate model for this region; 2) training these models on both surface water and groundwater data, unlike many studies that focus solely on one type of water data, allowing us to use these models for predicting both surface and groundwater dynamics; and 3) utilizing a large-scale dataset that includes daily records from 45 stations each for surface water discharge and groundwater levels, spanning 23 years, with these stations strategically distributed across Florida to ensure comprehensive regional coverage. This integrated and extensive dataset ensures robust model training and testing, thereby enhancing the reliability of our predictions. The findings from this study provide valuable insights for water resource management and planning in Florida and can be adapted for use in other regions with similar hydrological characteristics.
